Introducing my quote:

> Neque porro quisquam est qui 
> dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, 
> consectetur, adipisci velit...

Use the backtick to refer to a `function()`.
 
There is a literal ``backtick (`)`` here.

Indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces.

This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.
    With multiple lines.

Alternatively, you can use 3 backtick quote marks before and after the block, like this:

```
This is a code block
```

To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add the name of the language immediately
after the backticks: 

```javascript
var oldUnload = window.onbeforeunload;
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    saveCoverage();
    if (oldUnload) {
        return oldUnload.apply(this, arguments);
    }
};
```
